        <h4>WEB DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          This front-end web development certificate is all about designing and building websites that are focused on the needs of users, striking a balance between form and function. From the very beginning, you will explore the ideas of mental models and target audience personas. By taking a design-first, code-second approach, you will learn to structure content and make informed design decisions based on the needs of potential website visitors before writing a single line of code. Foundational concepts of writing valid HTML and CSS are paired with accessibility best practices to ensure you can implement your designs effectively and accurately. Through an introduction to JavaScript, jQuery, and data collection, you will explore adding simple interactivity and forms to your websites. Throughout these courses, you will practice meeting the needs of your target audiences while designing web experiences that are attractive, functional, and accessible.

          <p>
            Python is one of today’s most popular programming languages, with versatile uses across fields such as data science, software development, machine learning, and AI. As you complete the Python 360 Certificate program, you will gain an end-to-end understanding of the language and its adaptability to different applications and complex challenges.

            After completing your foundational courses, you will have the opportunity to choose two electives that align your personal areas of interest with applicable skills and frameworks in areas ranging from user-centered design, to statistics, to communication.
